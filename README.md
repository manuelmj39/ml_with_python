# ml_with_python
In this repository, I'll be doing some projects and courseworks related to machine learning using python. 
This will cover most of the basic machine learning algorithms like Linear regression, logistic regressions etc..

## Linear Regression With Scikit Learn
In this section we will be focusing on Linear Regression using Scikit Learn and will be trying out a project related to Linear Regression.
Linear regression analysis is used to predict the value of a variable based on the value of another variable. The variable you want to predict is called the dependent variable. The variable you are using to predict the other variable's value is called the independent variable.

### Types of Linear Regression
Linear regression can be further divided into two types of the algorithm:

* Simple Linear Regression:
If a single independent variable is used to predict the value of a numerical dependent variable, then such a Linear Regression algorithm is called Simple Linear Regression.
* Multiple Linear regression:
If more than one independent variable is used to predict the value of a numerical dependent variable, then such a Linear Regression algorithm is called Multiple Linear Regression.

### Linear Regression Line
A linear line showing the relationship between the dependent and independent variables is called a regression line. When working with linear regression, our main goal is to find the best fit line that means the error between predicted values and actual values should be minimized. The best fit line will have the least error.

### Feature Scaling
Feature scaling is the process of normalising the range of features in a dataset.
1. Normalization: Normalisation, also known as min-max scaling, is a scaling technique whereby the values in a column are shifted so that they are bounded between a fixed range of 0 and 1. MinMaxScaler is the Scikit-learn function for normalisation.

2. Standardization:  standardisation or Z-score normalisation is another scaling technique whereby the values in a column are rescaled so that they demonstrate the properties of a standard Gaussian distribution, that is mean = 0 and variance = 1. StandardScaler is the Scikit-learn function for standardisation.
