# ml_with_python
In this repository, I'll be doing some projects and courseworks related to machine learning using python. 
This will cover most of the basic machine learning algorithms like Linear regression, logistic regressions etc..

## Linear Regression With Scikit Learn
In this section we will be focusing on Linear Regression using Scikit Learn and will be trying out a project related to Linear Regression.
Linear regression analysis is used to predict the value of a variable based on the value of another variable. The variable you want to predict is called the dependent variable. The variable you are using to predict the other variable's value is called the independent variable.

### Types of Linear Regression
Linear regression can be further divided into two types of the algorithm:

* Simple Linear Regression:
If a single independent variable is used to predict the value of a numerical dependent variable, then such a Linear Regression algorithm is called Simple Linear Regression.
* Multiple Linear regression:
If more than one independent variable is used to predict the value of a numerical dependent variable, then such a Linear Regression algorithm is called Multiple Linear Regression.
